# DancePose-YOLOv8
Human pose estimation for dance videos using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. This project performs real-time keypoint detection and analysis on video data, leveraging Python and Ultralyticsâ€™ YOLOv8 framework.


Features:
- Real-time human pose estimation on video inputs
- Accurate keypoint detection using YOLOv8-pose pretrained weights
- Supports video file input (including dance clips)
- Outputs pose-annotated videos highlighting body joints and skeletons
- Saves output videos with synchronized audio (when available)
- Easily extensible for movement analysis or custom applications
